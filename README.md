## _Repalcement Power Supply for the Orignial Xbox!_

##### Disclaimer!
- I'm not an Electrical Engineer. Just wanted to make something cool and challenge myself.
- The OEM power supply can hold a potentially dangerous charge even after being unplugged for a large period of time!
- You're on your own, I'm not responsible for injury or damages. 

##### Features

- ✨Support 1.0 through 1.6 revisions consoles!  ✨   
   *1.0/1.1 requires the proper connector.  
   *Switching between 1.0-1.4 and 1.6s requires changing various components. Documented on bottom of the board.
- Any DC input from 16-20v, 100w+ (Including 100w USB-C Chargers)!
- User replaceable input modules.
- Direct Swap with OEM power supply.

##### Installation
- Warning again: The OEM power supply can be potentially dangerous even after being unplugged for a long periods of time.
- Proceed with caution!
- Make sure AC cord in unplugged! Then press the power button a few times to help discharge any residual power.
- Open console and remove HDD tray. Unplug the cable connecting the OEM power supply to the main board.
- Remove the two screws holding the power supply down. Slide to the front of the console.
- The power supply should be lift up and out now. Might have to angle to get it out of the shell.
- Installation is reverse order.

##### TODO

- Always looking for improvements.
- Provide physical designs for input modules.

##### FAQ
- Where can I buy?   
   Not for sale YET. Should have a test batch out to testers out in a few weeks. Hope Pre-Orders will be soon.
- Is it Open Source?   
   Eventually... Just not currently.
- Will "******" work as a power source?   
    I can't say. There's too many to test. I've tested my MSI laptop Charger (180w) and an Anker 100W USB-C charger. I dont see why anything similar whould not work
- Can you add "X" feature?
    The goal of the main PXU board is to power the console the same as the OEM power supply. Additional features can and should be added as a daughter board using the provided mount points.
