##### FAQ
- Where can I buy? 
** Not for sale YET. Should have a test batch out to testers out in a few weeks. Just because it works for me isnt good enough.
-Is it Open Source?
** Eventually... Just not now.
- Will "******" work as a power source?
** I can't say. There's too many to test. I've tested my MSI laptop Charger (180w) and an Anker 100W USB-C charger.
